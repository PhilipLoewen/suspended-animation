# Suspended Animation

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life for Arduino and an (8x8 LED Matrix)[https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11861].

The final product will be a self-contained unit, which runs without any connection to the outside world. The final setup will include an Arduino mini, the LED matrix, and a battery pack.

## Resources

* my Life implementation is a port of this (Processsing implementation)[https://www.processing.org/examples/gameoflife.html]
* I'm using the product's (sample code)[http://linksprite.com/wiki/index.php5?title=LED_Matrix_Kit#pcDuino_Sample_Code] to interface with the LED Matrix
* I will be looking at (this tutorial)[http://www.openhomeautomation.net/arduino-battery/] when I get to trying to run it off of a battery
