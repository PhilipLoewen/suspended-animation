# Suspended Animation

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life for Arduino and an [8x8 LED
Matrix](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11861).

The final product is a self-contained unit, which runs without any connection to
the outside world. It uses an Arduino Pro Mini, the LED matrix, and a battery pack.
